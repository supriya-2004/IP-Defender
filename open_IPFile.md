# **Node.js Script to Unblock an IP using Windows Firewall**

## **1. Importing Required Module**
```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');
```
- This line imports the `exec` function from Node.js's built-in **child_process** module.
- `exec` allows running **system commands** inside a Node.js script.

---

## **2. Defining the IP Address to Block**
```javascript
const ipAddressToBlock = '192.168.137.130';
```
- This variable stores the **IP address** that we want to remove from the firewall's block list.
- The script is designed to **delete a firewall rule** that blocks this IP.

---

## **3. Creating the Firewall Command**
```javascript
const command = `netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block IP ${ipAddressToBlock}"`;
```
- This command is meant to **delete a firewall rule**.
- `netsh` (Network Shell) is a **Windows command-line tool** used for network-related configurations.
- `advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block IP ${ipAddressToBlock}"`:
  - `advfirewall` â†’ Targets the **Advanced Firewall**.
  - `firewall` â†’ Specifies that we are working with **firewall rules**.
  - `delete rule` â†’ Removes a **specific firewall rule**.
  - `name="Block IP ${ipAddressToBlock}"` â†’ Deletes the rule named **"Block IP 192.168.137.130"**.

âœ… **Fixed Issue:**
- The original command lacked a **closing quote (`"`)**, which would have caused errors. Now it's corrected.

---

## **4. Executing the Command**
```javascript
exec(command, (err, stdout, stderr) => {
```
- The `exec` function **runs the command** in a **child process**.
- It provides three callback parameters:
  - `err` â†’ Captures errors (if any occur).
  - `stdout` â†’ Captures the **standard output** (successful execution messages).
  - `stderr` â†’ Captures the **error output**.

---

## **5. Handling Errors**
```javascript
if (err) {
    console.error(`Error executing command: ${err.message}`);
}
```
- If an error occurs while executing the command, it **logs the error message** to the console.

---

## **6. Printing Command Output**
```javascript
console.log(`Command stdout: ${stdout}`);
console.error(`Command stderr: ${stderr}`);
```
- `stdout` â†’ Prints **successful output** from the firewall command.
- `stderr` â†’ Prints **error messages** (if any).

---

## **ðŸ’¡ Full Functionality in Summary**
1. **Loads the `child_process` module** to run system commands.
2. **Defines the IP address** that needs to be unblocked.
3. **Constructs a Windows Firewall command** to delete the blocking rule.
4. **Executes the command** using `exec`.
5. **Handles success and errors**, logging them to the console.
